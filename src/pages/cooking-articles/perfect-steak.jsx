      <h2>Cooking the Perfect Steak</h2>
      <p>Achieving the perfect steak at home is an art that combines quality ingredients, proper technique, and attention to detail. Here's how to cook a restaurant-quality steak in your own kitchen:</p>
      
      <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 high-quality steak (ribeye, NY strip, or filet mignon)</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of vegetable oil or clarified butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 cloves of garlic (optional)</li>
        <li>Fresh herbs like rosemary or thyme (optional)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Instructions:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Remove the steak from the refrigerator 30-60 minutes before cooking to allow it to come to room temperature.</li>
        <li>Pat the steak dry with paper towels and season generously with salt and pepper on both sides.</li>
        <li>Heat a heavy-based skillet (preferably cast iron) over high heat until it's very hot.</li>
        <li>Add oil to the pan and when it starts to smoke, carefully place the steak in the pan.</li>
        <li>For medium-rare, cook for 3-4 minutes on each side, depending on thickness.</li>
        <li>In the last minute of cooking, add butter, garlic, and herbs to the pan. Tilt the pan slightly and baste the steak with the melted, flavored butter.</li>
        <li>Remove the steak from the pan and let it rest on a cutting board for 5-10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Slice against the grain and serve immediately.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Remember, the key to a perfect steak is starting with a quality cut of meat, proper seasoning, high heat, and allowing the meat to rest before cutting. With practice, you'll be cooking steakhouse-quality meals in no time!</p>
